Bank Tellers

Suppose a bank is open from 9:00 AM until 5:00 PM Monday-Friday. Assume customers
arrive via a Poisson process with the following rate per hour.

Time Rate
9:00-10:00 	8
10:00-11:30 	10
11:30-1:00 	12
1:00-3:00 	8
3:00-5:00 	11

Further assume the service time for each customer is well approximated by a Beta(1,2.3)
distribution. Suppose there are 4 tellers scheduled to work each day and is given a half hour
non-overlapping scheduled lunch break. The tellers continue working until the last customer
service is complete plus 15 minutes of busy time to close the back each day.

Simulate a day at the bank and estimate the percentage of time a teller is busy. How
many total hours does the bank pay the four tellers?

Simulate 10 days and estimate the percentage of time the teller is busy and the total
paid hours. From your 10 days, calculate a 95% condence interval for these parameters
using the appropriate procedure.
