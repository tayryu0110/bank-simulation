# Bank Simulation Project

  This project is the bank simulation that suppose a bank is open from 9:00 AM until 5:00 PM Monday-Friday.
Assume customers arrive via a Poisson process. Further assume the service time for each customer is well approximated by a Beta
distribution. Suppose there are 4 tellers scheduled to work each day and is given a half hour
non-overlapping scheduled lunch break. The tellers continue working until the last customer
service is complete plus 15 minutes of busy time to close the back each day.
